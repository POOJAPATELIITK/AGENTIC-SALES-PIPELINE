# Agentic B2B Sales Pipeline
## Project Overview

This project develops an Agentic B2B Sales Pipeline using Generative AI agents to automate lead management, qualification, and outreach. The system orchestrates multiple AI agents to fetch leads, dynamically score them, enrich data with real-time intelligence, and generate personalized email outreach. It leverages CrewAI, Pydantic, and OpenAI GPT-4o to ensure reliability, scalability, and contextual communication for modern B2B sales workflows.

## Workflow

* Implemented lead ingestion and validation workflows.

* Standardized lead data using Pydantic BaseModel for type-safe schema enforcement.

* Applied filters and prioritization logic to highlight high-value leads (score > 80).

* Integrated Serper API for real-time web intelligence and context-driven lead qualification.

* Applied YAML Schema for structured workflows and configurable execution.

## Results

Automated the complete B2B lead lifecycle from fetching to outreach and generated personalized, role-aware email outreach improving engagement rates.
